As a software engineering fellow with General Assembly, our capstone project was to create a single page React application with API implementation. I'm a huge Taylor Swift fan (I konw I know... who isn't at this point? But I swear I've been a fan since I was 12! No bandwagons here!) so I thought it would be fun to use the Ticketmaster API to track events that are playing for your favorite artist. The app utilizes a search bar to fetch data from the API, then allows users to add an event to their favorites section. 

Technologies Used:
React, Ticketmaster API, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Express.JS, MongoDB, Github and Node.js were used in the creation of this app.

Site Navigation
User comes to the home page of Venue Vibes.

User types in their favorite artist or event to receive a list of upcoming events for that artist.

Once the user clicks on an event, the details for an event including name, price range, venue, and an image populate.

The user can then click the Add to Favorites button to add the event to their Favorite Events section.

When clicking the Favorite Events navigation link, the page will navigate to the events that the user has favorited. The page will display these events in a list.

Next Steps:
I plan to update this app with the ability to delete an event from the favorites list. I also want to extend the list of events that will populate once a suggestion is typed into the search bar as the Ticketmaster API only calls for 20 events to be listed at a time currently. I'll also update the styling for the app overall just to give a little more pop while users scroll around.
